	<summary>
		Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the
		A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R. R. Martin,
		set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent
		of Essos.[5][6] The series follows several simultaneous plotlines
		.[7] The first story arc follows a war of succession among 
		competing claimants for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven
		Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from 
		the throne. The second concerns the actions of the exiled scion to
		reclaim the throne; the third chronicles the threat of the 
		impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce 
		peoples of the North.[8]
